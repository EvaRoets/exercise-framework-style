## Objectives
- Get acquainted with CSS Frameworks. Look, for example, at this [list of popular CSS frameworks from 2021](https://www.thecoderworld.com/top-8-css-frameworks-to-learn-in-2021/).
Bootstrap is probably the most commonly used, though that being said, who knows whether it should be...
- Explore the possibilities of frameworks

## Specifications
- The design department of your company sent you a new section that needs to be added to their corporate website. It is intended to show the benefits of using their services in an easy to understand way.
- Choose a framework, and recreate the layout below.
- On desktop, the layout should look like below. If possible, on tablets each row should contain 2 cards. On mobile all cards should be in one column.

### Must-haves
1. Choose a framework. If you don't have a lot of experience, start with a _component-first_ framework such as Bootstrap or Bulma. If you want to dare you can start with a _utility-first_ framework such as Tailwind, but beware that it might require extra time to set up.
2. You can find similar icons for free at https://www.flaticon.com/home (it's ok if they are not exactly the same: the layout, positioning and dimensions is what counts!)
3. Find a similar font on https://fonts.google.com/ (it's ok if it's not exactly the same, but try to respect font size, color, etc.)
4. First, try to get as close as possible without writing _any_ CSS. Start from the general structure (a responsive grid with rectangular "cards" inside), then proceed with the inner structure of each card.
5. Once there isn't anything more you can "extract" from the framework of your choice, you can start adding custom CSS
6. Deploy on the system of your choice (GitHub Pages or Netlify)

### Nice-to-haves
- Add a navigation sidebar to the left, with some dummy links in them
- Style the navigation bar using only the framework you selected
- Make it responsive and on mobile screens (< 768px) make sure the sidenav disappears completely
- When you move with your mouse over the "learn more" button, show a tooltip with some extra text

### Extra nice-to-haves

If you used a _component-first_ framework, do the same exercise but with a _utility-first_ framework. And viceversa.
