## üéØ Objectives
- Get acquainted with CSS Frameworks. 
- Explore the possibilities of frameworks

## ‚úîÔ∏è Specifications
- Choose a framework, and recreate the layout below.
- On desktop, the layout should look like below. If possible, on tablets each row should contain 2 cards. On mobile all cards should be in one column.

### üå± Must-haves
1Ô∏è‚É£ Choose a _component-first_ framework, such as Bootstrap or Bulma, or  _utility-first_ framework, such as Tailwind.   
2Ô∏è‚É£ Find similar icons for free at [https://www.flaticon.com/home](https://www.flaticon.com/home).  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Find a similar font on [https://fonts.google.com/](https://fonts.google.com/).  
4Ô∏è‚É£ First, style as much as possible with the framework. Then, style by adding custom CSS.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy on GitHub Pages or Netlify.  

### üåª Nice-to-haves
1Ô∏è‚É£ Add a navigation sidebar to the left, with some dummy links in them.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Style the navigation bar using only the framework you selected.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Make it responsive and on mobile screens (< 768px) make sure the sidenav disappears completely.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ When you move with your mouse over the "learn more" button, show a tooltip with some extra text.  

### üíê Extra nice-to-haves

1Ô∏è‚É£ If you used a _component-first_ framework, do the same exercise but with a _utility-first_ framework. And viceversa.
